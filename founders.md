# Founder Insights

> Status: outline. Expand each section with narrative summaries, key quotes, and interpretations.

## Austin Hurwitz

- **Article 1** — Focus on earning attention through craft instead of noise; "actions over words" philosophy; refusal to publish roadmaps. Notes on leaving Doodles to build Neuko with a tighter community filter.
- **Article 2** — Mindshare metrics vs. incumbents; critique of mercenary tactics; personal origin story (Amazon, music rights) and commitment to equitable systems; invitation to drop the old launch playbook.

### Themes to Highlight

1. Anti-mercenary distribution philosophy (no WL grinds, no KOL deals).
2. Belief in organic myth-building: "Neuko is in the eye of the
   beholder."
3. Expectation that operatives show patience and curiosity.

## Squinch

- **Post** — Rationale for transferable badges, celebration of early supporters, and emphasis on being "free" even if that means selling. Introduces Snake wave tease.

## Greenie

- **Post** — Tribute to community resilience, acknowledgment that conviction comes from members, not the core team.
