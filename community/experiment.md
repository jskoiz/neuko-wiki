# Community Social Experiment

> Analysis of the Snake badge distribution social experiment.

## Overview

The Snake badge distribution (Phase 3) was designed as a social experiment to test community values and loyalty. The results demonstrated strong community conviction and self-organization.

## The Experiment

### Setup

- Team gave Snake badges to Rabbit and Moth holders
- Gave complete freedom: Hold, Sell, or Give
- Holders were to distribute to people they thought would benefit the community
- No team oversight or control
- Tested community values and loyalty

### Hypothesis

In a down market, would holders sell free NFTs or demonstrate loyalty?

### Results

- Most holders chose to give badges to community
- Only 2-3% listed on Magic Eden
- Community self-organized distribution
- Rewarded engagement and contribution
- Some bought badges on secondary to gift others

### Significance

Demonstrated strong community values and conviction.

## Game Theory Elements

### 1. Status and Tribal Identity

- Badges create status and belonging
- Community-led distribution tests loyalty
- Creates sense of tribe and identity

### 2. Reciprocity and Trust Signaling

- Giving away valuable NFTs demonstrates loyalty
- Recipients feel indebted and emotionally invested
- Emotional reciprocity creates stickiness

### 3. Cooperative Scarcity

- Low listings (2-3%) create cooperative equilibrium
- Most holders aligned with long-term goals
- Coordination game playing out in real time

### 4. Delayed Revelation & Narrative Suspense

- Mystery sustains belief
- Each holder becomes part of story arc
- Sunk cost fallacy + consistency bias

### 5. Skin in the Game

- High entry price ($300+) filters for true believers
- Speculators deterred by uncertain future
- Core of value-aligned, emotionally invested holders

### 6. Low Supply, High Conviction Loop

- Scarcity + loyalty = liquidity crunch
- Low listings → steady floor → public perception of strength
- Attracts long-term interest → reinforces loyalty
