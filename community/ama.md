# Community AMA

> Summary of the first weekly community space.

## First Weekly Community Space (November 2025)

**Format**: Community call by community, for community  
**Focus**: Community, culture, and ongoing mystery (not hard shilling or roadmap)

## Key Points

### 1. Community First, Product Second

- Focus on people, culture, and evolving mystery
- Not classic "here is the mint date" promo
- Emphasis on community over marketing

### 2. Red Hoodie as Identity Layer

- Red hoodie PFP meme is strong
- Community pressure (jokingly) to adopt red hoodie
- Acts as soft filter and visible signal of belonging

### 3. Puzzles, Lore, and Thinkers

- Attracts people who enjoy decoding and storytelling
- Some see scattered dots, others connect everything
- Not just chasing floor price

### 4. Organic Reach

- Short early video spread organically
- Reached timelines of people who usually only see DeFi content
- Strong sign that visuals and meme are powerful

### 5. Credible Team

- Doxxed team with real track record
- Mix of mystery on top and proven builders underneath
- Early supporters feel comfortable leaning in

### 6. Culture, IRL Energy, Social Capital

- Goal is not only digital speculation
- Brand and community where people stay for relationships
- Events and shared rituals

### 7. Consistency as Currency

- Personal challenges (100-day running streak) linked to Web3 consistency
- Showing up, contributing, keeping promises = value
- Consistency treated as its own form of value

## Conclusion

People are not just betting on future drop, they're buying into a culture. Neuko is turning red hoodies, puzzles, and shared rituals into a social layer people want to belong to.
