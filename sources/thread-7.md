Media: 1 video (URL: https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1983930354034417664/vid/avc1/480x270/3QA1LS3upiIG5OdH.mp4, duration: 67442 ms)  Visual summary: A glitchy, retro TV broadcast style video flipping through channels (labeled CH 210, CH 814, etc.). Scenes include: a "Please Stand By" screen with "THRAX MEDIA" logo; a person climbing a fence on a highway; traffic jams; a political press conference; a screaming woman at a slot machine jackpot; a snake handler in a jungle; a taxi argument in a city at night; breaking news of a "Research Facility Attacked"; a phone on a desk being picked up; a record player in a bookshelf; a kitchen stove catching fire; a dark bedroom with a black jacket on the bed; a hand dialing a phone. Ends with the NeukoAI logo (three yellow figures on red) flashing multiple times. The style is dark, suspenseful, with static and glitches.  
Subtitles/Overheard Audio: Fragmented dialogues like "No way, no way this can't be this perfect," "Was not an attack but a mouth fu," "A jackpot! The snake Jack the local lab," "Actually quite gentle they would never," "Red hoodie or something little ears on top," "He just ran across the street behind us," "Go ahead Do you not think that distributing the snake badges via field operatives is going to result in Bad recruitment," "I don't know people selling positions for cognitive assessment," "Of course it is General chaos," "Listen, i've got under control Talked tomorrow."

I ran so many deep tests on the latest video - spectral, stereograms, high contrast frame by frame for QR codes, and looking for visual codes to break. I even broke out openpuff. Nothing.  At least I got some cool wallpapers out of it - here’s one I made using a contrast image.

We’d been looking too deep.
OUR TARGET WAS IN PLAINTEXT ON THE TABLE.
We found what looked like a Research Campus login page - but login disabled.
Looking at details - the signature is an unlabeled squiggle, SJ and section 14 don’t exist 
Into the console we go.
