 - The social experiment that's working.

1. Status and Tribal Identity - The team airdropped 200 Rabbit NFTs and 400+ Moth NFTs to the most engaged users as phase 1 regardless of following. Those holders were then told to airdrop 2 Snakes (rabbit holders) or 1 Snake (Moth holders) to people they deem worthy, putting the onus on the community.

2. Reciprocity and Trust Signaling - Telling Rabbit/Moth holders to give out the Snake NFT (Something worth $300-$500) created a trust based network. Holders who gave this away demonstrate loyalty and faith.

Those who receive a gift felt more indebted and emotionally invested. That emotional reciprocity creates stickiness, it's hard to sell something you were gifted as part of a loyalty ritual.

3. Game Theory: Cooperative Scarcity - By designing a structure where people benefit from holding rather than selling, they create something called cooperative equilibrium.

With only 2%-3% listed, it's clear most holders are aligned with long-term goals. A coordination game playing out in real time.

4. Delayed Revelation & Narrative Suspense - They are building something of value and something that is needed in Web3. It has the mindshare of some of the top projects in crypto purely organically.

- Each holder becomes part of a story arc.
- The more conviction they show, the more they'll want to be "right" later (sunk cost fallacy + consistency bias).

It's the same psychology behind cult brands and early stage communities because mystery sustains belief.

5. Skin in the game is selective filtering - Because snakes are $300+ the market naturally filters for true believers. Speculators who just want a quick flip are deterred by the high entry + uncertain future.

What's left is a core of value aligned, emotionally invested holders or the "army" that will evangelize organically.

6. Low supply, high conviction loop - Scarcity + loyalty = liquidity crunch.

-Low listings > steady floor price > public perception of strength > attracts more long-term interest > reinforces loyalty.

It's a self reinforcing social feedback loop that mimics what successful cult projects like Azuki or BAYC did, but with a more deliberate game theoretic structure.

Conclusion:

- If you got an NFT for free early on, you sold it, sold your snakes or did whatever, essentially that means it's fine, you were not the target for the team, some people need money more than others, and that's fine.
- If you got your NFT and followed through with the team's requests, you are exactly the holder they're looking for.
- If you fall in the Low listings > public perception of strength > attracts more long-term interest > and your in because you feel the quality of the lore, the team, the holders and just want to be apart of it, you are exactly the holder they're looking for.

Bullish on the team for taking the time to hand pick/manage and spend a lot of time cultivating the core user base.

There is a place for everyone, Chads in > Npc's out.
