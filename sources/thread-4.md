 (or not, its fine)… Anyways, here’s a quick briefing on what it is in case you didn’t pay attention to the timeline recently and is trying to catch up with it So let me try to ‘summarize’ it " with 1 photo.
Content:
First, a quick catch-up for those not up to speed with @neukoai
 and only seeing it from the sidelines:We are still unsure what Neuko is; there are theories but no confirmations yet.
The team has airdropped badges to early supporters and ensured an amazingly fair badge distribution.
There are no paid KOLs, no partnerships, no side deals - it might truly define what “organic” means
The team is closely watching the community, actively participating and engaging as members actively contribute to the canon lore.
This is a community that likes mystery, intelligence agency-like puzzles, and collaboration.

It so happens there was more to it, who would’ve imagined, right?At the scenes where the three shoutouts happen, there are hidden messages visible only if you adjust the image contrast - and keep your eyes glued to the screen.Do you see them?

" with 1 video.
Content:
It took a while for the community to find and decipher these codes, but once we found them, we didn’t know exactly what to do with them.I made a video in hopes of helping the community get on the right track.See if you catch anything in it here (How did I know to do it? More on that later)

Content:
It might look like a regular video - and it was just my artistic interpretation of the lore, so don’t mind what’s said in it.But I added something: a hint you’d only catch if you’ve been paying attention to the community

I assume that with the clues I’ve dropped here, you can already connect the dots and figure out the next steps.Lock in. By now you’ve probably suspect that I’m somehow involved, and you’re right.

Content:
The team has approached me and some other community members to be actively part of this puzzle, and we’ve played our parts.It was an amazing experience that I did not foresee happening in our Web3 How bullish it is that the team is actually watching the community, and dropping shoutouts and hints based on things that you’d only know if you’re part of it?!I’m extremely happy with it and I see this as a process of curating and cultivating the most engaged members

Now, that’s not the end of it.We are still unsure of the next steps.Did we miss more hidden clues and puzzles in the last video?How about the past videos? Did we miss something in them?The 24-hour deadline of the ultimatum to  hoarders has passed. What happened? What will be the consequence? We still don’t know
