been thinking a lot about the people that make 
@neukoai
 what it is. the ones who show up, build, create, share, and hold on when it’d be easier to walk away. some people are fighting battles no one sees, but still find the energy to believe.

i’ve heard a lot of stories like that already in our short time here. the fact that what we’ve built even makes selling an impossible choice for people is humbling. anyone could sell and quietly exit, but they stay because this means something to them. 

but the truth is, we didn’t build that part. you did.

this community has supported each other like none i’ve ever seen. it has so much heart. the people here are real and they’re all fucking beautiful. people here create for each other, lift each other up, and pour energy into everything they touch. every single one of you make this community the best place to be in the entire space.

grateful for everyone who’s believed, contributed, or even just stuck around to see where it goes.

we gave people a reason to join, but you give them a reason to stay.
