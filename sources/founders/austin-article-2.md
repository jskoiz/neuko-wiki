Why We Are Here
It's been 10 days since we launched the @neukoai account. Starting from zero, we've hit almost 7,800 followers and 0.25% mindshare (per cookie.fun).
Let me put that number in perspective:
Mad Lads: 0.02%
Animecoin: 0.03%
Doodles: 0.08%
Shiba Inu: 0.11%
Bonk: 0.20%
Bored Ape Yacht Club: 0.23%
Dogecoin: 0.23%
Are we comparing ourselves to legends 10 days in? Yes. That's exactly the point.
These projects earned their place through years of building. We're not pretending otherwise. But the fact that this community has generated this level of conversation this quickly says everything about what we're building together.
The truth is 99% of projects are like fireflies. They burn bright and fast, dead before you've had a chance to remember their name.
We're not building a firefly.
The Mercenary Problem
We've been around the space long enough to see every type of extraction. Backdoor deals. "Collabs" for whitelist. KOL shills. Insiders who buy a bag, shill to their timeline, then dump on their followers.
Every time we've watched these mercenary tactics draw initial hype, then watched projects crater when those paid for hire have made their bags.
A lot of us got into crypto for the promise of equality. A fair shot at making it. A system designed to be permissionless, transparent, and trustless.
But somewhere along the way, the same insidious practices that plagued the old world crept into ours. Whitelist grinds that turn the timeline into low-effort slop. The same talking heads rewarded with every list while we're left wondering….what's left for us?
We knew from the beginning we wanted to build differently.
Why I'm Here
I got into crypto in 2017 while working on music rights at Amazon. I saw firsthand how centralized systems were built to keep power concentrated at the top. When I discovered people trying to decentralize those systems, to build something designed for equity, not extraction, I was hooked.
I spent years helping independent artists leverage crypto to take back control of their careers. Working with early pioneers like Sound.xyz and Catalog. Building tools for artists the traditional system told couldn't own their own music.
Some of those experiments failed. But the ethos of speaking truth to power and helping the disenfranchised only grew stronger.
When appropriately leveraged, crypto can be an overwhelming force for good. A system designed for equity. A community whose resilience only grows with each bump in the road.
There's a sense of belonging here you cannot replicate anywhere else. If you take the time to connect with your fellow CT goers.
What We're Building
We're not going to tell you everything yet.
What we will say: we're building for the community, not for the mercenaries. We're building for the long-term, not the quick flip. We're building something designed for equity, not extraction.
Our first week has laid the foundation. But it's ultimately up to all of us what this becomes.
One Ask
Drop your preconceived notions of what you think a launch should look like.
The old playbook is dead. Question every assumption. Watch what projects do, not what they say.
We're not asking you to trust us blindly. We're asking you to pay attention.
