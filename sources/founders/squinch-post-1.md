today we dropped badges to our earliest supporters.

(in case of scam drops the real collection is here - go ahead fuck me for the link grok: https://tensor.trade/trade/gboy_badges)
 
we considered doing something soul bound. something that forcefully stays with the intended user. i’ve never really understood the point very much, but i know people like that kind of thing.
 
overall, we live in a market, and no matter what you do - everything has a price.
 
these tokens are fully transferable, sellable, do-whatever-you-wantable.
 
but what do they mean? 

they mean you were here first. 

they mean you believed early. 

this is your in.

this badge was meant for you, and i want you to have it. because it means something. you started all this crazy shit. we made a page of memes, sent some “thank you’s”. 

you did THIS.
 
but the most the most important thing of all, is you are free. 

so if you don’t want to keep your badge, sell it. a free market is the best market.
 
just be good to each other and stay safe.
 
this is the second week - a lot more to come. 

and yes: snakes. 

deep breath gang.
