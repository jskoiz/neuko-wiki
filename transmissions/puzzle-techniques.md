**Examples**:
- **Post #5 (Distribution Complete)**: Spectrograms reveal:
  - Time machine imagery
  - Testing chamber with badge on device
- **Discovery**: Found by @0xstateoftheart using audio tools

**Tools Used**:
- Audio spectrogram viewers
- Frequency analysis software
- Audio editing tools

### 2. Visual/Contrast Codes

**Description**: Hidden messages visible only when adjusting image contrast, brightness, or color levels.

**Discovery Method**:
- Frame-by-frame video analysis
- Adjust contrast/brightness in image editors
- Look for subtle text or patterns

**Examples**:
- **Post #7 (Channel Flipping)**: Hidden contrast codes at community shoutout scenes
  - Deciphered to: HOOTS-49, HOPS-13, STAYS-28
  - These codes given to community members (@satoshi_owl, @CharliegNFTeth, @TheKeeperOfX)
  - Combined to form PIN for neuko.ai website unlock
- **Post #8 (Ultimatum)**: Similar contrast codes in shoutout scenes

**Tools Used**:
- Image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP)
- Video frame extraction tools
- Contrast adjustment filters
